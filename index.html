    <p>"DevSecOps is a modern software development approach that emphasizes integrating security into the entire software development lifecycle, from design to deployment and beyond. It's all about ensuring that security is baked into the DNA of every aspect of the software development process. The goal is to identify and address security vulnerabilities early on, so that they don't become bigger, more expensive issues down the road. <br>

        <aside><p>In practice, DevSecOps involves a cultural shift within an organization, where security becomes a shared responsibility of the entire development team, rather than being siloed within a separate security team. This means that developers, operations, and security teams work collaboratively to ensure that security is a top priority at every stage of the software development process."</p></aside></p>
